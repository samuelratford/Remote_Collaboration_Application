## Running the Project
Step 1) Connect your computer to your WIFI hub using port 193, this means your internal IP address should now be 192.168.1.193

Step 2) Create an empty directory and navigate into it

Step 3) Open a terminal (or command prompt) in this directory and run the command “git clone https://git-teaching.cs.bham.ac.uk/mod-msc-proj-2019/sar912.git” 

Step 4) In a chrome browser type “chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure” in the address bar. They in the “Insecure origins treated as secure” text box type “http://192.168.1.193:3000” end enable the field. This is to allow webRTC to work on a local network without HTTPS.

Step 5) Enter the “sar912” directory

Step 6) In two separate terminals navigate to the “server” directory and run the command “node server.js”. In the other terminal navigate to the “client” directory and run the command “npm start”

Step 7) In the chrome browser enter “http://192.168.1.193:3000/”. You can now use the application.


## Generated code

####  All files in the folders named "node_modules" are either generated from the plugins given above under their license or are auto-generated by create-react-app (https://create-react-app.dev/) which itself is provided under an MIT license

#### This includes all files in client/public. It also includes all package.json, package-lock.json files and .gitignore files.

#### Generated code further described bellow

./client/node_modules <- This folder is entirely auto-generated

./client/public <- This folder is generated by create-react-app

./client/src/ <- Theses files were  created by Samuel Ratford

./client/src/extensions <- Written by Samuel Ratford with the exception of some parts of WebRTC.js and GraphDesmos.js as stated in the documents

./client/src/images <- These images were created by Samuel Ratford

./node_modules <- This folder is entirely auto-generated

./server <- Files created by Samuel Ratford (with the exception of package files which are generated as previously stated)

./server/models <- Written by Samuel Ratford

./server/routes <- Written by Samuel Ratford

./server/node_modules <- Generated as previously stated

###### For example, const mongoose = require("mongoose"), references the library mongoose, and import React from "react" references the library react.
